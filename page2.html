    <h1>About the so-called Russians, and what's wrong with them</h1>
    <p>I, like you probably, have been interested in one very interesting question for a long time:</p>
	<p>Why are the creatures who call and consider themselves Russian so strange, wrong and even disgusting?</p>
	<p>Just think about it, but this is the only people in Europe, and maybe in the whole world, having such delusional ideas about his own history, religion, culture and origin.</p>
    <p>The average "Russian" has absolutely no knowledge of the history of his people, even at a basic school level;</p>
	<p>understands nothing about Christianity, although he wears a cross and perhaps even goes to church;</p>
	<p>he himself may look like a typical Tatar, Dagestan or Tajik, and this will not raise questions in him;</p>
	<p>"Russian" culture usually turns out to be not Russian, but very much Soviet (later I will explain why).</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Russians have a very unique history, which, in fact, almost no one else had. It was history that led them to the conclusion that real Russians are an endangered species.</p>
	<p>They were serfs for several centuries and could not have their own land;</p>
	<p>then serfdom was abolished, and Russians gradually began to develop an understanding of what it meant to be a landowner.</p>
	<p>Before this understanding had time to become stronger, the Bolsheviks staged a revolution and began to destroy private property and kill wealthy landowners,</p>
	<p>those who refuse to give up their honestly earned property; peasants began to be forcibly herded into collective farms and forced to work not for their families, but for the benefit of the party.</p>
	<p>They began to cultivate the worst qualities in Russians and eradicate everything human.</p>
	<p>The criminal communist government deliberately created a famine, taking food away from people in order to turn them into inhumane cannibals, forcing them to eat their own children.</p>
	<p>They were taught submission to the criminal regime, forced to abandon relatives and the heritage of their ancestors.</p>
	<p>For many generations of Soviet citizens, the central cultivated image was Pavlik Morozov, who handed over his kulak parents to the authorities.</p>
	<p>This is far from the only case. In fact, there have been many such cases.</p>
	<br>
	<p>"Russians" have a strange relationship with religion: everyone is baptized, they wear crosses, sometimes they pray, and even go to church once a year. Needless to say, this is not enough?</p>
	<p>Of course, they have not read the Bible, and upon deeper questioning it turns out that they themselves do not know what they believe.</p>
	<p>They don’t even know the very basics, like the Holy Trinity and the Creed. At most, a few commandments can be told, and then in a very free interpretation.</p>
	<p>Instead, "Russians" prefer to light candles in churches, give money to priests, kiss holy relics and kneel before an icon.</p>
	<p>Of course, it would not be superfluous to mention that Christianity is not an original European religion, and it would be nice to return to paganism, the beliefs of our ancestors.</p>
	<p>But you shouldn’t expect these "people" to return to their roots. They completely abandoned their ancestors and their heritage.</p>
	<p>It would be true to note that the imposition of an alien religion is a crime against the people, and responsibility for this lies with the traitor Prince Vladimir, but now we are not talking about that.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Modern "Russian culture" is a hellish mixture of everything, often contradicting each other: Orthodoxy and some pagan traditions; nationalism and communism; egoism and collectivism;</p>
	<p>belief in horoscopes and psychics, magic and love spells; the cult of Tsar Nicholas II and Joseph Stalin; "peace to the world" and outright chauvinism; prison chanson and poems by Pushkin.</p>
	<p>Even on Red Square in Moscow you can see the Kremlin, the Orthodox Cathedral and the mausoleum of the communist Lenin.</p>
	<p>Many historically and culturally Russian cities were named after thugs, criminals and destroyers of the Russian people.</p>
	<p>St. Petersburg was named first in honor of Emperor Peter I, and then in honor of the communist resentmental scum called Lenin, who destroyed the Russian state and created a communist monster in its place;</p>
	<p>Volgograd was previously named after the even more resentmental murderer Stalin, who committed a real genocide of Russians, deliberately exterminating ethnic Russians.</p>
	<p>The culture of the "Russians" and their self-awareness actually has nothing specifically Russian in it. It is rather Soviet, over which a veil of Russianness has been thrown purely cosmetically.</p>
	<p>It was normal for Soviet people to consider a huge number of very different ethnic groups as part of one nation. Unfortunately, modern "Russians" have retained this quality.</p>
	<p>But the majority of "Russians" do not see any problem in this. Moreover, they don’t even find all this strange.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The communists created and spread the practice of denunciation. Now envious bastards could, with the help of the state, take away material wealth from richer and more successful people.</p>
	<p>The new government suppressed any dissent, aiming to destroy dissidents and the remnants of the intelligentsia who did not emigrate.</p>
	<p>For seemingly harmless actions, such as samizdat and the distribution of literature objectionable to the party,</p>
	<p>they could have been sent to the Gulag, into exile in Siberia, or simply shot. Executions, by the way, were often carried out without a trial, completely illegally.</p>
	<p>Russians were taught that human life means nothing, that a person is worth less than the bullet that will kill him.</p>
	<p>The state formed entire agencies whose purpose was to exterminate the most worthy people who wanted to preserve their previous way of life.</p>
	<p>During World War II, detachments were formed, also consisting of Russians, whose job was to shoot their fellow countrymen in the back if they disobeyed orders.</p>
	<p>After World War II, there were brutal reprisals against opponents of Soviet power. Hope was placed on these people. They were supposed to become liberators of the people, but were executed.</p>
	<br>
	<p>What is their life like? "Russians", as a rule, have very poor, unsuitable living conditions. A huge part of them live in Stalin's barracks without running water,</p>
	<p>sometimes even without electricity, they go to the street toilet and wash themselves from a plastic basin. Those who are a little luckier live in ugly, gloomy Soviet buildings.</p>
	<p>They are accustomed to poverty and destruction. Being poor savages is their way of life. "Russians" are known throughout the world for their rampant alcoholism. Alcohol is literally part of their "culture".</p>
	<p>The Russian Federation is one of the most drinking countries in the world. And this problem did not appear yesterday, but has been going on for a long time, since the period of the empire.</p>
	<p>The situation worsened significantly during the Soviet period in the 1980s, when it was estimated that every adult male consumed approximately 100 bottles of vodka annually.</p>
	<p>None of these problems have been fixed yet, and there are not even any attempts to do anything about them.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The origin is also very confusing. Over a very long period of time in one state with a huge number of different peoples,</p>
	<p>a huge amount of non-European admixture appeared in the Russian gene pool. Modern "Russians" have a lot of Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Mongolian, and other genes.</p>
	<p>Hence various problems with self-identification and often openly Asian appearance. A creature that calls itself and considers itself Russian may not even look like a European.</p>
	<p>Most "Russians" have already ceased to be people. Instead, they turned into humanoid creatures. They no longer have the right to bear the proud title of European.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The political amorphousness of the "Russians" is very well known. They absolutely do not care who rules them. In their heads there is only a postulate about impeccable obedience to the leader.</p>
	<p>They will carry out even the most brutal orders, participate in fratricidal operations, shed rivers of blood for the sake of the president, the tsar or the General Secretary.</p>
	<p>This leader can become absolutely any rogue who is lucky enough to eliminate all competitors. The "Russians" have a very developed Stockholm syndrome.</p>
	<p>This is precisely what explains their strong love for all kinds of murderers and cannibals, like Stalin and Putin. They love to be treated like pigs. This is their popular perversion.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Thus, all of the above led to the fact that the Russians were deliberately turned into cattle, which can be treated as you please.</p>
	<p>"Russian" is a degenerate, decayed offspring of the Russian, a parody of man, a bastard desecrating this world.</p>
	<p>At the moment, unfortunately, there are almost no real Russians and there is hardly any possibility of somehow reviving this ethnic group.</p>
	<p>Nobody is forever, nothing is forever.</p>
